And yes, testing counts as using. Because ofthis, the application's test suite skips anythingapproaching a real test unless you set these threeenvironment variables:AMAZON_S3_EXPENSIVE_TESTS            Doesn't matter what you set it to. Just has to be setAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID            Your AWS access keyAWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET    Your AWS sekkr1t passkey. Be forewarned that setting this    environment variable on a shared system might leak that    information to another user. Be careful.DEPENDENCIESThis module requires these other modules and libraries:    LWP::UserAgent    Digest::HMAC_SHA1    URI    XML::SimpleCOPYRIGHT AND LICENCEThe software is released under the Artistic License.
